B09 Lab week 8
This lab is on learning and practicing opendir(), readdir(), and closedir() to read a directory. They are fairly straightforward; please read their man pages (e.g., “man readdir”) for how to use them.

Write a C program list.c that takes 1 command-line argument for a directory name. Print the filenames and file types in that directory, one per line.

For simplicity, we only identify these file types: regular, directory, symlink; all other types (and unknown) are “other”. For simplicity again, you may assume that the non-standard d_type field is valid; this works on Mathlab and most Ubuntu installations. (A more proper way is to use the lstat() system call to get file types. You can look into it if interested.)

You will notice that the filenames are in an arbitrary order, and may even differ from the sample output below. This is normal. Just print in the order readdir() returns.

For simplicity, you may assume legal inputs as promised above, and omit most error handling, though it is always a good idea to check whether opendir() actually succeeds. If you add debugging/error messages for your sake, please send them to stderr only.

Sample output:

$ ./a.out /courses/courses/cscb09s24/laialber/l08
. directory
.. directory
symlink-to-list.c symlink
list.c regular
00-handout.html regular
Please submit your C file as list.c
